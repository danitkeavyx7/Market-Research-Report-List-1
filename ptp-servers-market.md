<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTP Servers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Clock</li><li>Boundary Clock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) server market, there are two primary types: Ordinary Clocks and Boundary Clocks. Ordinary Clocks serve as synchronized time sources for a network, typically syncing with a primary PTP grandmaster clock. They are simpler and ideal for smaller setups. Boundary Clocks, on the other hand, act as intermediaries that synchronize the time of incoming PTP packets and distribute it downstream, enhancing scalability and resilience in larger networks where precise timekeeping is crucial.</p></p>
