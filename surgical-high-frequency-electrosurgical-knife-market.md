<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical High Frequency Electrosurgical Knife Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Surgical High Frequency Electrosurgical Knife market primarily consists of two types: monopolar and bipolar devices. Monopolar electrosurgical knives use a single electrode to cut and coagulate tissue, requiring a grounding pad for current return. They are often preferred for broader surgical applications. In contrast, bipolar electrosurgical knives utilize two electrodes, applying current directly between them, allowing for precise tissue manipulation with reduced thermal spread. This leads to minimal collateral damage, making bipolar devices ideal for delicate surgeries.</p></p>
