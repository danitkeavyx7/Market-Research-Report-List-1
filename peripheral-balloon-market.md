<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Balloon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTA Balloon</li><li>DCB Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral balloon market comprises two main types: PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) balloons and DCB (Drug-Coated Balloons). PTA balloons are used to dilate narrowed or obstructed blood vessels during angioplasty procedures, effectively restoring blood flow. DCB balloons, on the other hand, are coated with medication that helps prevent restenosis by inhibiting cell proliferation after the balloon expands the vessel. Both balloon types are crucial in managing peripheral artery diseases and improving patient outcomes through minimally invasive techniques.</p></p>
