<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Release Polymer in Laundry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Type</li><li>Powder Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil Release Polymers (SRPs) are critical ingredients in laundry detergents that enhance fabric cleaning by allowing grease and stains to lift away more easily. In the market, SRPs are available in two primary types: liquid and powder. Liquid types are often more effective at immediately dispersing during washing, offering quick action and smoother application. Powder types, on the other hand, generally provide stability and longer shelf life, making them suitable for bulk manufacturing. Both types serve to improve fabric care and maintain garment appearance.</p></p>
